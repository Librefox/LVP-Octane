# LVP Octane

LVP Octane 2.0 is a benchmark that measures a JavaScript engine’s performance by running a suite of tests representative of certain use cases in JavaScript applications.

It is based on Octane 2.0 but most of the tests are removed to make it less variable as possible and thus more accurate
